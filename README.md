# Check Yo' Self

Check Yo' Self is the final project in Mod 1 of the Front End Engineering program at the Turing School of Software and Design. The author is a student in the 1903 Cohort.

## Learning Goals
The Check Yo' Self project is designed to implement numerous JavaScript principles taught during the first module at the Turing School, and builds on the Mod 0 and previous Mod 1 projects' complexities. Check Yo' Self also requires proficient use of Git and GitHub to track feature changes. The project relies on local storage and JSON for persistance on page load.

The project's goal is to create the HTML, CSS and two JavaScript files necessary to run a pre-designed list making application. Various styling specifications and functional goals were set for the students, including comps for desktop and mobile layouts. Several image assets were given to students for inclusion. I then created additional .svg image files for a graphic within a button element and the user prompt to create the first ToDo list.
